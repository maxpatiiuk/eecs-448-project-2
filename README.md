# Project 1: Battleship
<h4> Group 17 - EECS 448 </h4>
<small> This program contains a two player battleship game written in C++.</small>
<h2> Welcome to Battleship: </h2>
<small> The game allows players to choose the number of ships to play with (1-6), and then asks each player where they would like to place their ships. 
After all ships have been placed, players will take turns attacking their opponents ships. Attacks are sent by typing in the coordinate of the desired attack. While playing the game, players will have the ability to view their own board as well as the ability to view the attacks that they have sent on the opponents board. Once a player has sunk all of the other players ships, the game will end and the program stops running. </small>
